# cust-os
CustOS- The operating system where you have full control. You can use this in a vm.

Custos commands are used through the command prompt. The credits command displays the creators of Custos, Isaac Polomski, Roshan Inbasekar and Kirthis Kirubaventhan. The cmdlist command shows every available command and whether it is enabled, disabled, or protected; it cannot be disabled. The echo <text> command prints any text you enter back onto the screen, for example echo Hello displays Hello. The clear command clears the screen. The disable -<command> command disables a command so it cannot be used until it is enabled again, while the enable -<command> command restores a disabled command. The cmdlist, enable, and disable commands are protected and cannot be disabled. If you try to use a command that has been disabled, Custos will display error: Command not Found or not Enabled.
